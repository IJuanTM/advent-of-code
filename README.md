# Advent of Code

In this repository I will post my solutions to the Avent of Code questions. I do them for fun and try to complete as much of them as possible!

I started in 2023 and will try to do them every year from now. I will probaly mostly use Python as I think this is a good language to do these kinds of quick challenges in.
